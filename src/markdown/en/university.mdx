After high school, I enrolled at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague, where I completed my studies in 5.5 years. During that time, I spent about a year on an Erasmus exchange program in Germany, which was a valuable experience both professionally and personally.

This experience inspired me to explore new cultures and improve my language skills, so I also took a short-term summer job in the USA. Although it was just a kitchen helper position at a children’s summer camp, it significantly helped me improve my English and become more open to new challenges.

After graduating from university, I worked as a mechanical designer for several companies. Over time, however, I became increasingly interested in automation and efficiency—especially through programming. I started writing automation scripts for Excel (VBA) and macros for the 3D CAD software Catia (VBA, .NET).

Since I’ve always been drawn to computers and technology, it gradually became clear that my path would lead toward IT. Eventually, I shifted my focus toward web development, specifically frontend development.
