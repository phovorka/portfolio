I designed and implemented a complex online 3D configurator for creating custom smartwatch strap prints in real time.
/
I used the Three.js and WebGL libraries to render realistic 3D models with interactive rotation, zoom, and variant selection.
/
I integrated an API to convert the graphic design into a print-ready CMYK format.
/
I designed an intuitive UI in vanilla JavaScript, focusing on user experience and responsiveness across all device types.

I optimized the applicationâ€™s performance to ensure fast loading times, even on mobile devices.
