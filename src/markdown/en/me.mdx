I'm Lukáš.
\
\
I was born in Frýdlant, I grew up in Nové Město pod Smrkem, but I've lived
in Liberec since high school.
\
\
I definitely didn't want to move as a teenager,
but in the end I'm glad my parents made this decision.
It kind of opened up the world to me.
\
\
If I'm not working or studying in the IT field,
I try to spend time outdoors with friends or on trips.
\
\
I love traveling. Oh, and I'm also a huge Formula 1 fan,
I'd definitely like to experience a race weekend live at least once 🏎️
\
\
I am a happy husband and father of our son ❤️
