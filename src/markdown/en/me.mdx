My name is Petr.
\
\
When I’m not working or furthering my education in the IT field, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my kids, especially on family trips and little adventures.
\
\
I’m a big fan of sports — especially team sports — so I’m always up for a game of football with friends.

I’m a happy husband and a proud father of two ❤️
