My next work experience was
at the Prague startup Integromat (now Make).
\
\
I started there as a Frontend coder in a smaller team that was in charge of various
presentation websites and landing pages.
The primary stack was HTML/Pug, Sass, JavaScript/jQuery.
\
\
I was in charge of coding a new website with a presentation of the culture
and team in the company, along with a list of vacant positions.
I also participated in the redesign of existing sites, such as the internal knowledge base
or documentation for the API.
\
\
After some time, our team was moved to the Core team, which was in charge of the product itself.
There, they were already writing in Angular and Typescript.
\
\
This chapter gave me a lot of experience in web development and agile development of own product.
\
\
The combination of a full remote working mode and the ongoing restructuring of the company
made me think whether to try something new, ideally near Liberec.
